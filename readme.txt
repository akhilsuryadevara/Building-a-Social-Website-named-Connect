We group of three people have created a new Social website called "Connect" where initially users can register and follow some people they know. They now can go to the Home page to go through the live feed(posts posted by other users) and can like/dislike/comment on these posts. They could write testimonials for the people they know and can view all the testimonials given to them.
Users can connect to people based on city or school and can search friends directly in the search bar which is implemented with the help of AJAX. 
They could see their own data by clicking the "MyProfile" Option.
Users can see their followers and people they are following on the associated tabs shown in the header section. They could also see the trending tweets on the Trending tab.
Admin can delete posts posted by the user if they are spam or misleading.
Admin also can add/delete advertisements where user can see them and which upon clicking would direct them to the respective sites. 
Admin can also see number of posts posted and number of comments posted until now.
This code is implemented with the help of Apache Tomcat Server,MYSQL and MongoDB.
Please look at output.pdf file for more clarity.
